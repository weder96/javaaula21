/**
 * Imperative-style programming to iterate over the list and get the names of cars made later than
 * the year 2000. We then sort the models in ascending order by year.
 *
 * <p>As you can see, there's a lot of looping in this code. First, the
 * getModelsAfter2000UsingFor method takes a list of cars as its parameter. It extracts or filters
 * out cars made after the year 2000, putting them into a new list named carsSortedByYear. Next, it
 * sorts that list in ascending order by year-of-make. Finally, it loops through the list
 * carsSortedByYear to get the model names and returns them in a list.
 *
 * <p>This short example demonstrates what I call the effect of statements. While
 * functions and methods in general can be used as expressions, the {@link Collections} sort method
 * doesn't return a result. Because it is used as a statement, it mutates the list given as
 * argument. Both of the for loops also mutate lists as they iterate. Being statements, that's just
 * how these elements work. As a result, the code contains unnecessary garbage variables
