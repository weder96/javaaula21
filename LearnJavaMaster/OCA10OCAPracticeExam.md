Chapter 10
OCA Practice Exam
This chapter contains 80 questions and is designed to simulate a real OCA exam. While
previous chapters were focused on a specific set of objectives, this chapter covers all of
the objectives on the exam. We recommend you take this exam only after you score well
on the questions in the individual chapters.
For this chapter, you should try to simulate the real exam experience as much as possible.
This means setting aside 150 minutes of uninterrupted time to complete the test, as well
as not looking at any reference material while taking the exam. If you donâ€™t know an
answer to a question, complete it as best you can and move on to the next question, just
as you would on a real exam.
Remember, the exam permits writing material, such as a whiteboard. If you do not have a
whiteboard handy, you can just use blank sheets of paper and a pencil. If you do well on
this test, then you are hopefully ready to take the real exam. With that said, good luck!
