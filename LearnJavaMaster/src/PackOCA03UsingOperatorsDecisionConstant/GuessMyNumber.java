 * DEBUG THIS! Exercise
 * 
 * Learning to read & debug existing code is an important skill.
 * Fix the errors in this program. 
 * Try not to re-write the program, just correct what's wrong.  
 * 
 * This program will generate a random number between 1 and 5 then as you to
 * "guess" the number. It will tell you if you're right or not.
